#hi! This is my first ever project that i did in college.

#I used Mint Linux as my Server and Kali Linux as my Client.
#I want to send a file from client to server.
#make sure if you're using vmware workstation, change the network mode to bridged mode. 
#Server's Job:-> Create Socket
              -> Configure Tcp/Udp
              -> Bind the Host ip address
              -> and Port No.
              -> Listen
              -> Accept
#Client's Job:-> Create Socket
              -> Connect to Server
              -> Send Files
